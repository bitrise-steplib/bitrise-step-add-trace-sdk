title: Add Trace SDK
summary: Add the Trace SDK during the Xcode build process.
description: |
  Adds the Trace SDK static library during the Xcode build process into the resulting app artifact.
  
  iOS:
    The step works by linking and modifying the relevant Xcode project descriptor files to include necessary configurations in `other linker flags`. These are the following:
      - Trace static library path
      - System libraries: `C` and `C++` 
      - System Framework `SystemConfiguration.framework`
    
    System libraries and frameworks are linked if they are not present. Itâ€™s recommended to add this step just before the Xcode build and archive step. 
    This step is compatible with all Xcode projects that use Swift only, interoperability (mixed) and Objective-C only languages. 

  Android:
    TBA.
    
  Once the app has been deployed, developers can view the results of the app in the Trace addon.
